# Contributing

- Please understand that dotfiles are after all personal. I can accept features I do not personally want, but in that case I will ask you to make it configurable/optionally loaded
- If you add new stuff, it's a good idea to ask me first to not waste your work
- Please make multiple PRs if you have many features

# Technical steps

_Complete steps, might not be necessary depending on what you change_

- Install the dotfiles (if you don't wanna replace your stuff completely, do it on a new user)
- For Quickshell: `touch ~/.config/quickshell/ii/.qmlls.ini` for proper LSP support
- Make changes, copy changes to a fork, PR
