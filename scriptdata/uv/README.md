## Why is this important?
Instead of installing python packages via system package manager, we should install them into virtual environment.

This is important because there has been so many complaints about the failure installing/updating python packages via system package manager, see [#1017](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/1017).

## How to add/remove python package?

1. Edit `requirements.in`. You may refer to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) for possible package names.
   - See also [uv doc](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/dependencies/#using-requirementsin).
2. Run `uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt` in this folder.

## How will the python packages get installed?

- They will be installed to the virtual environment `$ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV`.
- The default value of `$ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV` is `$XDG_STATE_HOME/quickshell/.venv`.
  - The default value of `$XDG_STATE_HOME` is `$HOME/.local/state`.
  - Currently we use `env = ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV, ~/.local/state/quickshell/.venv` in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland/env.conf` to set this environment variable.[^1]
- See the function `install-python-packages()` defined in `/scriptdata/lib/package-installers.sh` for details.

[^1]: Hyprland seems to have weird problem dealing with recursive variable, so we can not use `$XDG_STATE_HOME/quickshell/.venv` even if we had set `$XDG_STATE_HOME` to `~/.local/state` explicitly, else `$XDG_STATE_HOME` will possibly not get expanded but get recognised as literally `$XDG_STATE_HOME`. This problem never happens for some users, but according to some issues when we were using recursive variable setting in the past, it's possible to happen for other users. Reason unknown.

## How to use the python packages installed through here?

Basically you'll need to activate the virtual environment first:
```bash
source $(eval echo $ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV)/bin/activate
```
then use the python package inside it;
After that you probably need to deactivate it:
```bash
deactivate
```
### Situation 1: Call the command directly
Take `kde-material-you-colors` as example.
```bash
source "$(eval echo $ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV)/bin/activate"
kde-material-you-colors "$mode_flag" --color "$color" -sv "$sv_num"
deactivate
```

### Situation 2: Use python script (wrapped)
Take `generate_colors_material.py` as example:
```bash
source "$(eval echo $ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV)/bin/activate"
python3 "$SCRIPT_DIR/generate_colors_material.py" "${generate_colors_material_args[@]}" \
  > "$STATE_DIR"/user/generated/material_colors.scss
"$SCRIPT_DIR"/applycolor.sh
```

### Situation 3: Use python script (shebang)
**Note**: This method is only for simple situation.
It can not deal with complex arguments (e.g. filaname containing spaces) passed to the python script.

Take `generate_colors_material.py` as example, add the shebang below to its beginning:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S\_/bin/sh\_-c\_"source\_\$(eval\_echo\_\$ILLOGICAL_IMPULSE_VIRTUAL_ENV)/bin/activate&&exec\_python\_-E\_"\$0"\_"\$@""
```
Then you should run the script directly, i.e. `./generate_colors_material.py`, **not** `python3 generate_colors_material.py`.
